/*
 * Capability derivation tree
 *
 * All seL4 kernel objects (aka capability) are assigned a capability
 * derivation tree node which is inserted into a capability derivation
 * tree, whose the root node is the root untyped capability from which
 * the child capability is ultimately derived. When capabilities are
 * minted, copied, or derived via Untyped_Retype, the new capabilities
 * are inserted into the capability derivation tree as the child of the
 * original capability. When a capability is moved or mutated, the
 * original tree node is updated with the new capability pointer. When
 * the capability is revoked, its children are deleted and freed (but
 * the node itself is not). When the capability is deleted, all its
 * children as well as the node itself are deleted and freed.
 *
 * The set of capability derivation trees derived from each root untyped
 * form the capability derivation forest. This forest is organized by
 * the physical address of the untyped caps in an AVL tree, and is stored
 * in the PHY_MEM_DESCRIPTOR struct as RootUntypedForest.
 *
 * Note: a CNode is always the leaf node of a capability derivation tree,
 * since a CNode cannot be minted or mutated. We do not directly copy a
 * CNode capability. When we are in the process of expanding a CNode, we
 * always create a new larger CNode and copy old capabilities into the new
 * one, and then delete the old CNode, releasing both ExPool memories and
 * freeing the untyped memory that the old CNode has claimed.

 *
 * In terms of ownership of the memory pages within the VAD, there are two types

 * maps other owned memory regions via seL4_CNode_Copy, possibly with different

 * A VAD node does not in general track the commitment status of individual pages.
 * Callers of MMVAD routines must manage this themselves. An example here is the
 * cache manager that tracks the individual page commitment status via a multilevel
 * table structure (see CC_VIEW_TABLE, CC_VIEW, and relevant routines in Cc).
 *
 * A MirroredMemory is a type of VADs that map another OwnedMemory VAD (typically
 * within another VSpace) into a VSpace, possibly with a different WindowSize
 * and access rights. The commitment status of the MirroredMemory VAD is kept
 * in sync with the owned memory (within the address window of the mirrored VAD),
 * meaning that when the pages of the owned VAD are committed, the mirrored VAD
 * will have the corresponding pages mirrored as well, if these pages are within
 * the address window of the mirrored VAD.

 * struct or DATA_SECTION_OBJECT struct. Since multiple SECTION objects can point
 * to the same FILE which can be mapped as image or data, the IO_FILE_OBJECT contains
 * pointers to both IMAGE_SECTION_OBJECT and DATA_SECTION_OBJECT.
 *
 * Note the nomenclatures here are somewhat confusing as the PE object format also has
 * a notion of "sections". A PE file can have multiple sections (.text, .data, etc)
 * which are loaded into memory according to its image headers (including the
 * section headers). During loading NTOS will create a SECTION object for the
 * PE file, which will simply be a pointer to an IMAGE_SECTION_OBJECT struct,
 * that contains multiple SUBSECTIONS each of which corresponds to a section
 * of the PE image file (plus one additional SUBSECTION for the PE image header).
